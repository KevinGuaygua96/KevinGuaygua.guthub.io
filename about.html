        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome, my name is Kevin Guaygua and this is my page.
        <br>Just a quick introduction as to why I have created this page.
        <br>I used to study ICT in college and university, but I failed my first year, and since then,
        <br>I have forgotten much about computing and the rest that comes with it.
        <br>This page was created to help me remember what I've forgotten and just keep practicing really.
        <br>This page is just a rough idea on what I can do with coding with HTML and CSS,
        <br>so I will be updating this page quite frequently, so bare with me please.
        <br>So in other words, it's a work in progress.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>The contents of this page will be just basic stuff about me,
        <br>for example, what I enjoy, what kind of music I listen to, things like that.
        <br>
        <br>Many Thanks, <i>Kevin Guaygua,</i> AKA <i>SalchiPapi</i>
        <br>
